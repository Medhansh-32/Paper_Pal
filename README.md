## Project Overview 🏠

The **PaperPal** application has been refactored from HTML/CSS/JS to **React** with **TypeScript** for improved type safety and component-based architecture. The application provides a web interface for users to upload, manage, and download exam files. It supports managing user responses and linking those responses to exam files. Additionally, users can interact with an AI assistant powered by **Google Gemini** via the home page. The application also allows users to post and resolve doubts related to exams, fostering better learning and communication.

Moreover, when a PDF is uploaded, it is analyzed by AI to ensure it meets the required guidelines. If the document does not comply, it gets rejected automatically, reducing manual effort in the review process.

## Features 🌟

1. **Question Paper and Notes Upload and Download**:
    - Users can upload exam files and download them by accessing the file details through the application.
    - When a user uploads a PDF, it is analyzed by Google Gemini AI in parallel using multithreading to ensure the file meets guidelines and is study-related.
    - If the file is not related to study materials, it is automatically rejected, reducing manual effort.

2. **Ask AI**:
    - The integrated AI assistant allows users to ask questions, similar to ChatGPT, to get instant responses for better learning and problem-solving.

3. **Doubts Postings**:
    - Users can post doubts, respond to others' doubts, and manage their doubts effectively. This feature promotes collaboration and clarity among students.
